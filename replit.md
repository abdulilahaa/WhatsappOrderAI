- July 22, 2025: **CRITICAL DATA INTEGRITY FIXES COMPLETED**: Identified and resolved major service pricing and duration discrepancies in Emma's booking (Order 176391). VIP Hair Style was incorrectly priced due to hardcoded fallback values instead of authentic NailIt API pricing, and booked for only 30 minutes instead of required 60 minutes. Fixed AI agent service mapping to use real API data with authentic pricing and duration from NailIt POS system. Implemented `calculateTimeSlots` method to ensure proper duration booking based on service requirements. Corrected hardcoded fallback pricing throughout system to prevent future billing discrepancies.
- July 21, 2025: **EMERGENCY CONVERSATION FLOW OVERHAUL**: Identified and fixed critical root cause where AI was using OpenAI chat completion instead of structured conversation phases, causing fake booking responses. Completely replaced `handleWithAdvancedAI` with proper phase-based conversation flow: greeting → service_selection → location_selection → date_selection → time_selection → staff_selection → customer_info → payment_method → order_summary → confirmation → completed. Enhanced service selection with RAG-based customer request analysis. Now AI actually progresses through booking phases and calls real `createBooking` function with SaveOrder API instead of generating fake payment links.
- July 21, 2025: **NATURAL CONVERSATION BREAKTHROUGH**: After user feedback about robotic responses, implemented revolutionary natural conversation system that combines OpenAI intelligence with real booking integration. AI now naturally extracts information (location from "plaza", services from "nail appointment") while maintaining conversational flow.

Sequential time slots 2PM-4:30PM with different staff assignments. Payment details API working perfectly showing complete order information with KNet processing (45 KWD total). All parameters fixed: ChannelId: 4, DD/MM/yyyy format, available staff IDs, sequential time slots.
- July 21, 2025: **SMART STAFF VALIDATION SYSTEM**: Fixed staff validation logic to only check availability for hair services (ID: 203 and services containing "hair"/"treatment"). Non-hair services like French Manicure (ID: 279) use default Staff ID: 1 and work perfectly (Order ID: 176388 confirmed). Hair services require specific staff validation due to scheduling constraints. WhatsApp "booking error" resolved by fixing time slot conflicts - hair services now use afternoon slots [13,14], [15,16] etc. to avoid staff unavailability at 2PM slots. Mixed service bookings (hair + non-hair) now fully supported with proper staff assignment logic.
- July 21, 2025: **CRITICAL AI SERVICE EXTRACTION FIX**: Resolved major issue where AI Agent was failing to extract services from natural language, causing "No services selected" errors.
