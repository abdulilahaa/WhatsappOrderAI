# CRITICAL DATA INTEGRITY AUDIT

## Issue Identified
User correctly identified pricing discrepancy:
- **Claimed**: VIP Hair Style = 15 KWD
- **Expected**: VIP Hair Style = 40 KWD (per user knowledge of actual NailIt POS)
- **Problem**: Using incorrect/hardcoded pricing instead of authentic NailIt API data

## Investigation Required
1. Verify actual Service ID 279 pricing from live NailIt API
2. Check if order 176391 was created with wrong pricing
3. Ensure no hardcoded fallback data is being used
4. Verify all service data matches authentic NailIt POS system

## Data Sources Being Verified
- Live NailIt GetItemsByDate API response
- Order Payment Detail API response  
- Service catalog integrity
- Pricing accuracy across all services

## Expected Resolution
- Prove exact pricing from authentic NailIt API
- Fix any hardcoded/fallback pricing
- Ensure 100% authentic data integrity
- Validate all service information matches live POS system
