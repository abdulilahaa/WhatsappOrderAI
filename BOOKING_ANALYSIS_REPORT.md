## Analysis: Why These Results Occurred

### 1. **Separate Orders Architecture**
**Why**: NailIt POS system requires individual orders per service rather than bundled multi-service orders.
**Impact**: Creates multiple Order IDs but allows individual service management.

### 2. **Staff Assignment Logic**
**Why**: System checks real staff qualifications for each service type.
**Result**: Roselyn qualified for multiple services, Claudine specialized in nail services.

### 3. **Time Slot Management**
**Why**: System calculates duration-based slot allocation (30-minute increments).
**Result**: Prevents overlapping bookings and ensures realistic scheduling.

### 4. **Payment Processing**
**Why**: Each order generates separate payment link for individual processing.
**Result**: Customers receive multiple payment links but can process sequentially.

## Improvements for Enhanced Booking Security

### 1. **Bundled Payment Processing**
```javascript
// Proposed Enhancement
const bundledPayment = {
  customerOrderIds: [176379, 176380, 176381],
  totalAmount: 75,
  singlePaymentLink: true
}
```

### 2. **Staff Conflict Detection**
```javascript
// Enhanced Availability Check
const staffConflictCheck = {
  staffId: 12,
  existingBookings: getStaffBookings(12, "23-07-2025"),
  proposedSlots: [10, 13, 14],
  conflictDetection: true
}
```

### 3. **Real-Time Availability Validation**
```javascript
// Continuous Availability Monitoring
const realTimeValidation = {
  checkInterval: 30000, // 30 seconds
  revalidateBeforeCreation: true,
  lockTimeSlots: true
}
```

### 4. **Sequential Booking Optimization**
```javascript
// Smart Time Slot Assignment
const optimizedScheduling = {
  minimizeGaps: true,
  sameStaffPreference: true,
  travelTimeBetweenServices: 15 // minutes
}
```
