## 🎯 AUTHENTIC DATA ENFORCEMENT

**Before**: System had 648+ hardcoded products and services with fake pricing
**After**: System exclusively uses authentic NailIt POS API data

- ❌ No hardcoded service IDs
- ❌ No hardcoded pricing (15, 40, 9, 20 KWD)
- ❌ No hardcoded product catalog
- ✅ Only authentic NailIt API responses

## 👨‍💻 USER EXPERTISE ACKNOWLEDGED

**The user was absolutely correct** - there were multiple layers of hardcoded data that I had missed:

1. **Dashboard Products**: 648 hardcoded entries
2. **AI Service Data**: Multiple hardcoded services with fixed pricing
3. **Route Test Data**: Additional hardcoded pricing references
4. **Documentation References**: Historical hardcoded data in markdown files

## 🚀 SYSTEM STATUS: 100% AUTHENTIC DATA

The system now requires and uses ONLY authentic NailIt POS data with zero tolerance for hardcoded values, exactly as the user demanded.

**Historical Order Issue**: Previous orders may have contained hardcoded pricing. System now enforces 100% authentic NailIt API data with zero tolerance for hardcoded values.
