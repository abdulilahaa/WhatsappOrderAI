 AI Doesn't Understand the User’s Initial Question
Issue: User asked “What treatments do you recommend for my oily scalp?” but the AI skipped the question and just dumped a random package of services.

Fix: The AI must analyze keywords (e.g., oily scalp) and recommend relevant treatments from the RAG knowledge base, ideally also asking follow-up questions (e.g., “Is your hair also thinning?” or “Do you experience dandruff?”).

🔁 2. Services Were Pre-selected Without Confirmation
Issue: The AI immediately returned 3 unrelated treatments with a total duration and price, without the user selecting any.

Fix: Use a recommendation-based approach where the user gets suggestions with explanations and can choose what to add. This ensures personalization and relevance.

📅 3. Date Conflict Handling Is Broken and Repetitive
Issue: When the user typed "Wednesday", the AI repeated an error message saying “No time slots available on 22-07-2025” — which is not Wednesday. It was stuck in a loop.

Fix: There’s a bug where the system confuses the input date with the wrong date (22 instead of 23). Also, it keeps repeating the same error message instead of checking actual availability for the chosen date.

⌛ 4. No Smart Scheduling for Service Duration
Issue: The AI asked "when would you like to come?" without understanding that the user needs 2h 30min of total service time. It should have looked for an available 2h30 block between 11:00 AM–8:30 PM.

Fix: Once services are selected, the AI should:

Query real-time availability for blocks that fit total duration

Present available time blocks (e.g., “You can come on Wednesday between 1:00–3:30 PM”)

Split services across staff only if needed

💬 5. Natural Conversation Flow is Broken
Issue: The AI talks like a form, not a human assistant. It doesn’t acknowledge inputs properly and keeps repeating unhelpful messages.

Fix: Add natural confirmation responses and eliminate robotic repetition:

"Got it! You’d like to come Wednesday at 1 PM — let me check availability for your selected treatments (2h30min)..."

If failed: “Unfortunately, we don’t have a continuous slot at that time. Would you like to split your services across 2 staff members or try a different time?”

💳 6. No Mention of Payment Options or Confirmation
Issue: The AI doesn’t confirm the price again, offer payment options, or clearly move toward finalizing the booking.

Fix: Once time is locked, it should summarize the booking and proceed to single payment link creation and confirmation.

Suggest relevant services with brief explanations.

Let the customer choose which services to add.

Calculate total time and price once services are selected.

Ask for preferred location and check real-time staff availability.

Find time slots that fit the entire duration of selected services.

If needed, intelligently split services across staff to provide a continuous appointment block (e.g., 10 AM–12:30 PM).

Offer available time options clearly.

Confirm services, staff, location, time, and total price.

Generate one unified payment link for all services.

Confirm booking success and offer post-booking support.

💬 Conversational Behavior
