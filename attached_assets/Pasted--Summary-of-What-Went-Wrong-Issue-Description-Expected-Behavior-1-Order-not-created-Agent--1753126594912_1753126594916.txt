🔍 Summary of What Went Wrong
❌ Issue	💥 Description	✅ Expected Behavior
1. Order not created	Agent said booking was done, but never triggered the SaveOrder API.	Must send the full order payload to SaveOrder with Channel_Id: 4, POS_Location_Id, Payment_Type_Id, etc.
2. Broken payment link	Sent a KNET URL that didn’t resolve.	The link must only be sent after receiving a valid ORDER_ID from SaveOrder.
3. Asking if payment was done	Agent asked: “Did you complete payment?”	It should call the payment status API (likely CheckPaymentStatus or another system endpoint) and confirm based on that.
4. No order summary shown	Didn’t display staff, service list, time, date, or payment method.	After confirmed payment, must show full order summary including: Order ID, services, staff assigned, time/date, location, and payment type.
5. Agent said “One moment…” but didn’t reply	Agent stalled without continuing the flow.	Agent must track context and re-enter the flow if it pauses, or give a fallback: “I’m checking on that now…”

🛠 How to Fix This in the Agent’s System Prompt
You need to amend the system prompt with precise logic and strict requirements so the agent won’t skip critical backend actions.

Here’s the patch you should append to the current system prompt:

🔐 Booking Confirmation & Payment Verification Logic
After sending the SaveOrder API request:

✅ Wait for a valid ORDER_ID in the response. Do not send a payment link unless the order was created successfully.

💳 Generate the payment link using:
http://nailit.innovasolution.net/knet.aspx?orderId={ORDER_ID}
Send this to the customer with clear instructions.

🕵️‍♀️ Monitor for payment confirmation. Do not ask the customer if they paid.
Instead, call the payment confirmation API (e.g., CheckPaymentStatus or system-specific endpoint) using the ORDER_ID to verify.

✅ Once payment is confirmed:

Show the customer a full booking summary:
• Order ID
• Services booked
• Staff members assigned
• Appointment date & time
• Branch name
• Payment method & status

🧠 Always maintain conversation state. If the agent says “Let me check…” or pauses, it must continue the flow without customer follow-up.

✅ Bonus: Post-Booking Template
When payment is confirmed, the agent should send something like this:
