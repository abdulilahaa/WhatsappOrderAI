where did you find the French Manicure, 25 KWD? i dont see it in the nailit POS?
did you forget how we used the ReAct orchestrator,

"As you start building the ReAct orchestrator, it’s absolutely critical not to forget or lose connection with any of the core components already developed across your existing system — this includes the RAG search pipeline (especially the service descriptions and treatment logic), the API orchestration layer (for SaveOrder, GetAvailableSlots, GetServiceStaff1, GetPaymentTypesByDevice, GetOrderPaymentDetail), the conversation state manager (whether in-memory or stored externally), the live slot planning logic that ensures back-to-back scheduling across multiple services without time gaps, the multi-service payload packager that ensures all selected services fall under one unified order for payment and confirmation, the order payment status checker (not asking the customer but confirming via API), the dynamic prompt override panel that lets you control system instructions and personality from the admin side, the logging and fallback mechanisms when services or staff return null or empty results, and the database sync jobs that update services from NailIt’s backend into the local RAG layer — all of these must be either actively integrated or gracefully replaced. You must also ensure that the orchestrator respects system config like location IDs, staff IDs, time formatting, and customer profiles from WhatsApp sessions, and maintains conversation continuity between interactions — don’t allow the LLM to go off-script or forget context mid-way. Lastly, if you’ve added custom side panels (like prompt editors or debug dashboards), these must still sync correctly with your orchestrator logic, especially when new prompt settings are published. If even one of these elements is skipped or silently disconnected, the AI may respond incorrectly, fail to book correctly, or generate broken orders or links, so keep a checklist and test end-to-end flows repeatedly during integration."
