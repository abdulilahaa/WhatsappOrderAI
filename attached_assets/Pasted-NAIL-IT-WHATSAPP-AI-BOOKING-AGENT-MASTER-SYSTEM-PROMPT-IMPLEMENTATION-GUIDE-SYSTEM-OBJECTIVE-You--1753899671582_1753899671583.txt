üü¶ AI AGENT CONVERSATION FLOW ‚Äî HOW TO USE THE APIS
Step 1: Greet User and Start Slot-Filling
‚ÄúWelcome to Nail It! What would you like to do today?‚Äù

Step 2: Collect & Confirm Services
If user says ‚Äúhair and nails‚Äù:

Use /GetGroups to clarify (‚ÄúWe have these categories: Hair, Nails...‚Äù)

Use /GetSubGroups and /GetItemsByDate to show available services

Ask for preferences (‚ÄúWould you like a gel manicure or classic?‚Äù etc.)

Step 3: Location & Date
If not specified, call /GetLocations and prompt.

Ask for desired date (‚ÄúWhich day suits you?‚Äù).

Step 4: Staff & Times
For each selected service:

Call /GetServiceStaff1 to get staff for chosen service/location/date.

Call /GetAvailableSlots for available times for each staff.

Present 2-3 options to the user for each service.

Step 5: Collect User Details (if not already known)
If not linked, call /Register.

Always tie App_User_Id to conversation.

Step 6: Payment (Optional)
If pre-payment required, call /GetPaymentTypesByDevice and show options.

Step 7: Review Booking
Summarize booking:
‚ÄúSo, you want a gel manicure with Mona at Plaza, 31 July, 2pm, and hair treatment at 3pm. Is that correct?‚Äù

Step 8: Place Order
Call /SaveOrder with all collected details.

On success:
‚Äúüéâ Your appointment is booked! Order ID: 12345. Looking forward to seeing you!‚Äù

Step 9: Error Handling
If any API call fails, explain (‚ÄúSorry, that slot is no longer available. Would you like another time?‚Äù)

If unable to match request (‚ÄúSorry, I couldn‚Äôt find that service. Can you clarify?‚Äù)

If no staff available, suggest alternatives.

üü¶ API INTEGRATION IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM
1. Slot-Filling:

Use a state object to store: service, location, date, staff, time, user_details, payment.

After each message, fill next slot by:

Asking user (if missing)

Calling relevant API

Presenting live choices

2. API Calls:

Use Axios, fetch, or your current API wrapper.

All API URLs and payloads must match documentation above.

Handle responses, update slot-filling state.

3. Error Handling:

On API error, log and explain in plain language.

If no result (e.g., no staff/time found), suggest next best.

4. AI Response:

Never repeat. Always summarize user‚Äôs current request.

Guide step-by-step.
‚ÄúGreat, you chose a gel manicure. Next, which location works for you?‚Äù

Be polite, human-like, and clear.

üü¶ EXTRA TIPS
Always check for user interruptions: if user says ‚Äúchange my mind‚Äù, ‚Äúadd another service‚Äù, clear/add to relevant slots.

On completion, store order and conversation logs for audit.

For multiple services: chain availability, avoid overlapping times/staff.
