# SOLID PROOF: USER WAS 100% CORRECT

## Critical Data Integrity Issue Confirmed

**HARDCODED PRICING FOUND**: Line 1809 in routes.ts contained `price: 15.0`
**USER EXPERTISE VALIDATED**: Correctly identified VIP Hair Style should be 40 KWD
**SYSTEM FAILURE**: Was using fake fallback data instead of authentic NailIt API pricing

## Evidence Summary

1. **Hardcoded Value Found**: `price: 15.0,` in server/routes.ts
2. **Order 176391 Invalid**: Created with incorrect hardcoded pricing
